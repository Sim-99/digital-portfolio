# Career Counselling

## Evidence
I participated in a career counselling session offered through the university. The session involved completing self-assessment questionnaires and discussing possible ICT career paths with a counsellor. I received feedback on my communication, analytical, and design skills.

## Reflection (STAR Technique)

*S – Situation*: I was uncertain about which career path within ICT would best suit my personality and skills.  
*T – Task*: Gain clarity on potential roles that align with my interests in web development and problem-solving.  
*A – Action*: I attended a one-on-one career counselling session and completed personality and interest assessments.  
*R – Result*: I realized that careers in front-end development and UI/UX design align closely with my skills and interests. This has motivated me to deepen my skills in React and JavaScript.
