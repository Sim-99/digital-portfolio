# Career Counselling

## Evidence

As part of the Work Readiness module, I completed an online career counselling assessment that helped me identify my top interest areas and suggested career paths in the ICT field. The results indicated that I have strong traits in the following areas:

- *Artistic* – I enjoy creativity, design, and expressive work, especially in front-end development.
- *Investigative* – I like solving problems and working through logic-based challenges.
- *Realistic* – I’m hands-on and enjoy building things that work efficiently.

These traits are reflected in my passion for web development, UI/UX design, and the ability to create solutions like the pizza shop app and animated SVG scenes.

Here is a screenshot of my career interest profile result:
