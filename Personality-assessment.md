# Personality Assessment

## Evidence
Based on my work style, interests, and self-assessment, I identify with traits often associated with problem-solvers and creatives in the ICT field. I enjoy building things from scratch, solving logic-based challenges, and designing user-friendly interfaces. My passion for web development, attention to detail, and self-motivation align with personality traits common in roles like front-end developer or UI/UX designer.

I am naturally focused, creative, and persistent when solving problems—especially in programming. I also enjoy working independently, yet I value clear structure and feedback, which help me improve.

## Reflection (STAR Technique)

*S – Situation*: While exploring my career direction in ICT, I wanted to understand how my personality could influence the roles I’d thrive in.  
*T – Task*: Assess my personality traits based on my work habits and learning experiences.  
*A – Action*: I reflected on how I approach projects like the library system, drum challenge, and pizza website. I noticed I am most productive when solving real problems, building clean interfaces, and improving user interaction.  
*R – Result*: I discovered that my strengths include focus, creativity, and technical curiosity—traits that suit front-end development, UI/UX design, and project-based work. I plan to further develop these traits while building more real-world applications.
