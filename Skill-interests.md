# Skills and Interests

## Evidence
I am passionate about web development and enjoy building interactive applications. Below are some of the projects I’ve developed that demonstrate my skills and interests:

### 1. E-commerce Pizza Website (React.js)
- Built using React and styled with CSS modules.
- Users can view different pizza sizes, edit pizza details (like toppings or size), add pizzas to the cart, and remove them.
- This project helped me understand component structure, props, and state management in React.

### 2. Library System (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- A project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to add, view, and remove books. 
- A browser-based application that allows users to borrow books.
- Includes a due date tracker and calculates fines for late returns.
- It showcases basic CRUD operations and time-based logic using JavaScript.

### 3. Drum Challenge (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- An interactive drum kit where users press keys to trigger different drum sounds.
- Includes visual feedback using animations and sound integration.
